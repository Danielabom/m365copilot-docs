# Publish plugins and Graph connectors for Copilot for Microsoft 365

[!INCLUDE [preview-disclaimer](includes/preview-disclaimer.md)]

This article describes the current state of Microsoft 365 distribution options and procedures for Copilot extensibility. Depending on its intended purpose as a line-of-business or marketable software solution, plugins and connectors can be published to your organization or to the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace  through [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com).

The following table summarizes the distribution support for Copilot extensibility scenarios, according to single tenant (line-of-business) or multitenant (independent software vendor, or *ISV*) channels.

|Copilot extensibility type  | Single tenant  | Multitenant| Notes|
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
|[Teams message extension apps as plugins](#teams-message-extension-apps-as-plugins-for-copilot) | ✔️ |✔️||
|[Power Platform connectors as plugins](#power-platform-connectors-as-plugins-for-copilot)| ✔️|✔️||
|[Microsoft Graph connectors](#microsoft-graph-connectors-for-copilot)| ✔️| ✔️*| *Standalone connectors not supported; can be distributed as Teams apps for verified publishers|

The remainder of this article outlines the distribution processes for each Copilot extensibility type.

## Microsoft 365 and Copilot program

As an independent software publisher, you can distribute your app through the  [Microsoft 365 and Copilot](/partner-center/marketplace/why-publish) program of Microsoft Partner Center.

Submission of your app package to the program requires compliance with the following certification policies for acceptance to in-product stores.

For message extension plugins and Microsoft Graph connectors:

- Microsoft Commercial Marketplace certification policies:
  - [100 General](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#100-general)
  - [1140 Teams](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1140-teams) (including [1140.9 Teams apps extensible as Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 plugins](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11409-teams-apps-extensible-as-microsoft-365-copilot-plugin))
- [Teams Store validation guidelines](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines)
- [Publisher verification](/entra/identity-platform/publisher-verification-overview)

For Power Platform connectors as plugins:

- [Prepare Power Platform connector and plugin files for certification](/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission)

## Teams message extension apps as plugins for Copilot

When Teams message extension apps used as plugins for Copilot are packaged and distributed in the same way as [Microsoft Teams apps that are integrated](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/test-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps) to run across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. As such, they're available to end-users both as plugins and [message extensions apps](/microsoftteams/platform/m365-apps/extend-m365-teams-message-extension) that work directly in [Microsoft Teams chat and Microsoft Outlook email](/microsoftteams/platform/m365-apps/overview#personal-tabs-and-messaging-extensions-in-outlook-and-microsoft-365-app) compose windows.

### Distribute custom apps as plugins to your organization

Follow these [instructions to upload your custom app package](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#upload-custom-teams-apps-that-work-on-outlook-and-the-microsoft-365-app) to the **Integrated Apps** section of Microsoft Admin Center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)). From there, admins can manage access, configure default settings, and review and consent to the requested data and permissions for both your [app experience](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#how-to-manage-the-availability-of-an-app-in-your-organization) and [plugin experience](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps).

### Distribute plugins through Microsoft Partner Center

Ensure your app meets validation criteria for [Teams apps used as plugins for Microsoft Copilot](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines#teams-apps-extensible-as-microsoft-365-copilot-plugin), then submit your app package to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com) through the **Microsoft 365 and Copilot program** as a **Teams app**.

Once validated and approved by Microsoft, your plugin is an active offer in the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace and ready for IT enablement. Once enabled by an IT administrator, it appears in the **Copilot extensions** category of the store within Microsoft Teams. Once deployed by an admin or acquired by a user, it will then appear as an installed plugin of Copilot for Microsoft 365 chat.

## Power Platform connectors as plugins for Copilot

Power Platform connector plugins can be shared across an organization or published broadly to the in-product Teams app store. In both cases, Power Platform plugins can be used in Copilot for Microsoft 365 once the *Dynamics 365 and Copilot Studio* app is deployed from Microsoft Admin Center. From Microsoft Admin Center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)), open Settings > Integrated Apps > **Available Apps** and select **Dynamics 365 and Copilot Studio**.

### Distribute a Power Platform connector plugin to your organization

By default, Power Platform plugins are only visible and usable in Power Virtual Agent or Copilot Studio by the person who created them. They can be authorized for sharing at the Power Platform object level.

Follow these [instructions to share a custom connector](/connectors/custom-connectors/share) using Power Apps portal ([make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/environments/customconnectors)).

In order to use the connector as a plugin, the *M365 Copilot* setting must first be enabled in Power Platform admin center. From Power Platform admin center, open Environments > Product > Settings > **Features** and select **M365 Copilot**.

### Distribute a Power Platform connector plugin through Microsoft Partner Center (preview)

Ensure your app meets certification criteria for [Power Platform Connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission), then submit your [app package](/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission#connector-and-plugin-packaging-guide) to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com) through the **Microsoft 365 and Copilot program** as a **Power Platform Connector**.

Once certified and published by Microsoft, your connector is available on Power Automate, Power Apps, and Logic Apps and your plugin is ready for IT enablement in the Microsoft Admin Center. The Copilot plugin will then appear as an installed plugin in Copilot for Microsoft 365.

For more info, see [Get your Power Platform connector and plugin certified](/connectors/custom-connectors/submit-certification).

## Microsoft Graph connectors for Copilot

Microsoft Graph connector publishing options depend on whether you have a standalone connector or a connector that's part of a Microsoft Teams app. While both scenarios are supported for single-tenant distribution, submission to the Microsoft Partner Center *Microsoft 365 and Copilot program* is currently limited to Graph connectors packaged within Teams apps.

### Distribute a Graph connector for Copilot to your organization

For **standalone Graph connectors**, follow these [instructions to set up and manage Microsoft Graph connectors](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector) in the Microsoft Admin Center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)).

For **Graph connectors within Teams apps**, follow these [instructions to upload your custom app package](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#upload-custom-teams-apps-that-work-on-outlook-and-the-microsoft-365-app) to the **Integrated Apps** section of Microsoft Admin Center ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)). From there, admins can manage access, configure default settings, and review and consent to the requested data and permissions for both your [app experience](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365#how-to-manage-the-availability-of-an-app-in-your-organization) and [plugin experience](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps) (if applicable).

### Distribute a Graph connector for Copilot to the Teams app store

For **Graph connectors within Teams apps**, ensure your app meets validation criteria for [Apps extended across Microsoft 365 clients](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines#apps-extended-across-microsoft-365-clients), then submit your app package to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com) through the **Microsoft 365 and Copilot program** as a **Teams app**.

Once validated and approved by Microsoft, your app is an active offer in the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace and ready for IT enablement. Once enabled by an IT administrator, it appears in the **Copilot extensions** category of the Store within Microsoft Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Microsoft 365 and Copilot program* for Microsoft Partner Center is currently limited to Graph connectors within Teams apps. Standalone Graph connector publishing through Partner Center is not currently available.
